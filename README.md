# Investment Risk Management Project

This project explores essential techniques for quantifying and managing investment risk. By the end, you'll be equipped to assess portfolio performance using the Treynor Ratio and calculate Value at Risk (VaR).

## Project Overview

This project focuses on two key aspects of investment risk management:

* **Quantifying Risk-to-Reward:** Learn to evaluate portfolio performance by calculating the **Treynor Ratio**. This metric helps you understand the return generated per unit of systematic risk.
* **Calculating Value at Risk (VaR):** Discover how to estimate potential portfolio losses using VaR. This technique provides a statistical measure of downside risk, helping you understand the maximum expected loss over a specific time horizon.

## Learning Objectives

* **Calculate Value at Risk (VaR):** Master the methods for determining the potential loss in value of a risky asset or portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval.
* **Quantify Risk-to-Reward using the Treynor Ratio:** Understand and apply the Treynor Ratio to assess the risk-adjusted performance of an investment portfolio.

## Key Concepts

* **Treynor Ratio:** Measures the excess return earned per unit of systematic risk (beta). It's a useful metric for evaluating portfolios against market benchmarks.
* **Value at Risk (VaR):** A statistical measure that quantifies the potential loss in value of an asset or portfolio over a specific time period for a given confidence level.
* **Systematic Risk (Beta):** The risk inherent to the entire market or market segment.
* **Portfolio Risk:** The overall risk associated with a collection of investments.
